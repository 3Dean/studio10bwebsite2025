This tech demo showcases the potential of real-time WebGL environments — blending art, atmosphere, and interactivity. At its heart lies a virtual art gallery, where users can explore creative works in a space that feels alive, responsive, and thoughtfully designed. Every detail — from reactive lighting to floating particles — is engineered to pull the viewer deeper into the narrative of the space.",
